6. Please explain your hands-on experience working with Debian or Debian-based environments and why you would be a great fit for this role
I’ve run Debian and derivatives in production for years: minimal headless installs, hardened SSH, UFW/iptables, Fail2ban, unattended-upgrades, AIDE, auditd, sysctl tuning, and central logging (rsyslog → Graylog/ELK). I manage packages with APT/dpkg, handle pinning/holds/backports, and maintain internal repos. I build automation with Bash and Ansible (idempotent roles for sshd, users/sudoers, services, timers) and integrate with CI/CD to ship tested images and configs. I’m a strong fit because I treat Debian as a product: reproducible builds, drift-free config, auditable changes, and fast incident response.
7. Please confirm that you understand this is a software engineering role focused on designing, implementing, and automating Debian-based deployment workflows — not a desktop administration or support role.
Yes, I understand the requirements of the role. And I also want to emphasize that I have already successfully worked in a similar role.  
8. Describe your experience in managing Debian package systems (APT, dpkg) and automating environment configuration or deployments using Bash, Ansible, or similar tools.
APT/dpkg: repo management, sources.list.d, GPG keys, pinning, package holding and unholding, backports, rollbacks, apt-mark, and dpkg. I have also built .deb packages.

Automation: Bash for provisioning, all and most configuration done is as bash scripts ; Ansible roles for sshd hardening, users/groups/sudoers, UFW/FW rules, Fail2ban jails, unattended-upgrades, systemd units/timers, log shipping, and monitoring agents; templated configs with Jinja2 and CI-validated inventories
9. Do you have prior experience implementing secure configuration standards or system hardening for Debian-based production systems?
Yes,  I follow the standard practices I've learnt from my experience as a DevOps engineer and previous workplaces, and also I follow conventions outlined in the official debian documentation and guidelines. 

For example:  I’ve implemented CIS/Debian-aligned hardening in production: key-only SSH (root login disabled), strong ciphers, UFW default‑deny with explicit allows, Fail2ban, unattended‑upgrades, auditd, sysctl network and kernel hardening, strict file permssions and umask, least‑privilege as a convention for sudoers, and periodic compliance checks automated via Ansible/CI.
10. Provide a self-rating from 1–10 (10 being expert) for your expertise in: a) Debian system configuration and package management b) Automating deployments and CI/CD integration in Debian environments
A) Debian configuration and package management: 9/10 — hands-on expertise, well-informed, fast and reliable under pressure.

Automating deployments and CI/CD: 8.5/10 — good pipelines toolchain and workflow exposure and repeatable builds. Decently good with github action and jenkins. 
11. This engagement is for 1.5 months. Are you aligned with the duration of this project/engagement?
Yes. 
12. The project requires a minimum of 20 hrs/week of time commitment (We have 3 options of time commitment: 20 hrs/week, 30 hrs/week or 40 hrs/week). Are you able to commit the required time necessary for this project?
Yes, I am up for this commitment. 
13. Can you complete our evaluation process in the next 24-48 hours? And how soon can you start with us (for e.g. I can start by DD/MON/YY)?
